# New daVinci Blockly

Google's Blockly is a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can drag
blocks together to build programs.  All code is free and open source.

This fork of Blockly includes blocks to represent code for controlling a
Parrot Rolling Spider Minidrone.

After making changes to the blocks code, generate the compressed JavaScript
file by running:

`python build.py`
